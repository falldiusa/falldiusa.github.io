        <p>Rose was born and raised in Chicago, and attended Simeon Career Academy. 
        </br>He was highly recruited by colleges, eventually choosing to join the University of Memphis under coach John Calipari. </br>
        Rose led the Tigers to the most wins in NCAA history (a 38–2 record), their first number 1 ranking in 25 years, and an appearance in the NCAA championship game. </br>
        In 2009, an NCAA investigation revealed that Rose's SAT scores had been invalidated, and as a result, the NCAA vacated Memphis' entire 2007–08 season.</p>
